<h1>About</h1>
<br>
<p>Real Madrid Club de Fútbol is a professional football club based in Madrid, Spain. The club first participated in a European competition in 1955. The first international cup they took part in was the Latin Cup in which they participated as champions of Spain. The competition lasted from 1949 to 1957 and Real Madrid won both tournaments which they entered, the same number as Barcelona and Milan. Since becoming the first Spanish club to enter the European Cup in 1955, Real has competed in every UEFA-organized competition, except the Intertoto Cup and Conference League. They have missed out on European football only twice in their history, in the 1977–78 and 1996–97 seasons.

    Real Madrid has had the most success in the European Cup, winning the trophy for a record fourteen times. Real was the winner of the inaugural edition of the tournament and remains the only club to win the trophy five times in a row (the first five editions). It also holds the distinction of being the only club to defend the title in the Champions League era, as well as to win it three times in a row.[1] The club has also won the UEFA Cup twice, in 1985 and 1986, the Super Cup five times, in 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2022, the Intercontinental Cup three times, in 1960, 1998, and 2002, and the FIFA Club World Cup five times, in 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2022. Real Madrid, with 29 continental and worldwide trophies, is the most successful team in international club football.</p>

<h1>European Cup / UEFA Champions League</h2>
    <br>
    <P>The European Cup was inaugurated in 1955 as a tournament for the champions of European national leagues, with Real Madrid winning the first five editions.[3] However, after winning the trophy five times in a row in the 1950s, and again in 1966, the club experienced mixed fortunes until the end of the 1990s. Since then, Real Madrid has won the competition eight times, in 1998, 2000, 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2022 and established itself as one of the premier sides in European football.[4]</h2>
